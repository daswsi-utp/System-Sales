This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
npm install react-icons --save
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

# Sales-System
## Description 
In this project, the objective is to automate and efficiently manage a company's product marketing process. This system allows for customer registration, product and inventory management, sales processing, issuing receipts (such as invoices or bills), and generating sales reports in real time. The application is designed with an intuitive interface to facilitate user interaction and is structured into functional modules, such as the inventory module, the sales module, and the reporting module. In addition, databases are implemented for secure information storage, and object-oriented programming principles and good development practices are applied.

The main objective of the system is to improve operational efficiency, reduce human error, and provide more precise control over business operations.
